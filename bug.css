The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations within CSS. However, it can sometimes lead to unexpected behavior if not used correctly. For example, if you try to use `calc()` with units that are not compatible, it may result in an error. Another potential issue is if you forget to include spaces between the operators and values within the `calc()` expression. This can also lead to an error or unexpected result.
